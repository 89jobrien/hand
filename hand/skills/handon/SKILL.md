# handon — Session-Start Handoff Reader

## Overview

Scan the current directory tree for handoff files, parse items by priority, and act:

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| P0 | Validate current state immediately. Report to user. Ask before touching anything. |
| P1 | Execute autonomously. Stop only if scope expands or something unexpected happens. |
| P2 | Delegate to subagents. Cap at 5 concurrent. |

## Steps

### 1. Find handoff file

```bash
handoff-detect          # sh version
handoff-detect.nu       # nu version (same flags)
```

- Exit 0 → file exists, path printed — read it
- Exit 2 → file missing, expected path printed — offer to create via `/handoff`
- Exit 1 → not in a git repo — report and stop

If invoked from a workspace root (e.g. `~/dev`) with no `.git`, sweep subdirs with `find . -name "HANDOFF.*.*.yaml" | sort` instead.

If only a legacy `HANDOFF.md` exists at repo root, read it as freeform. Do not convert unless asked.

### 2. Pull latest state from doob

Before parsing the local file, sync doob → HANDOFF.yaml to pick up any status changes made outside this session:

```bash
doob handoff sync --file <path-to-HANDOFF.yaml>
```

If `doob` is not on PATH, skip and continue with the local file as-is.

### 3. Review on wake

Before triaging by priority, scan all items for unreviewed `human-edit` entries — any `extra`
entry with `type: human-edit` and no `reviewed` field (or `reviewed` is absent).

Surface these first, regardless of item priority:

```
## Review on Wake

- [id] "[title]" — human edited `<field>` → `<value>` on <date>
  <note if present>
```

Do not act on these items automatically. Present to user and wait for acknowledgement before
proceeding to P0 triage. After the user acknowledges, note which items were reviewed — `handoff`
will stamp `reviewed: <today>` on those entries at session end.

### 4. Parse items

From `HANDOFF.yaml`: read `items` list directly. Filter to `status: open` or `status: blocked`.
Items with a `doob_uuid` are tracked in doob — their status is authoritative from the sync above.

From `HANDOFF.md`: read the "Known Gaps", "Next Up", "Parked", or "Remaining Work" sections. Infer priority:
- P0: "broken", "fails", "blocked", "urgent", "security"
- P1: specific file + known fix mentioned
- P2: everything else that's safe

### 4. Triage P0 items

For each P0:
1. Run relevant validation (`cargo check`, `git status`, test run)
2. Report finding to user with current state
3. Ask for go/no-go before acting

Do not proceed to P1/P2 until all P0s are acknowledged by user.

### 5. Execute P1 items

Work through each open P1 without asking. Stop and surface to user when:
- Scope expands beyond what the item described
- Tests fail unexpectedly (not the known failure)
- More than 3 files need changing beyond what was described
- Any destructive operation would be needed

### 6. Delegate P2 items

Dispatch one subagent per P2 item (cap 5 concurrent). Each subagent must:
- Receive explicit `--allowedTools` list
- Verify `git status` is clean before starting
- Commit its own changes
- Report back with result

### 7. Report and update

After all work:

```
## Handoff Triage — <path/to/repo>

P0:
  - [id] [name] "[title]" → [state found] → [action / question]

P1:
  - [id] [name] "[title]" → done | blocked: <reason>

P2:
  - [id] [name] "[title]" → delegated | skipped: <reason>
```

Then update `HANDOFF.yaml`:
- Mark done items `status: done`, add `completed: <today>`
- Add `log` entry for this session (one-liner, prepend to list)
- Update `state` with current build/test status
- Run `doob handoff sync --file <path>` to push status changes to doob
- Commit: `git add HANDOFF.yaml && git commit -m "docs: update handoff"`

## Edge Cases

**No handoff file found:** Report "No HANDOFF.yaml found in `<path>`." Offer to create one via `/handoff`.

**HANDOFF.md only:** Read it, triage as normal, note at end: "Consider migrating to HANDOFF.yaml for structured triage."

**All items done or parked:** Report clean state, no action needed.

**Blocked item:** Do not attempt. Report the blocker to user verbatim from the `description` field.
